The class assignment was to take existing map and landform code and use it to add more landforms and loop the player on the map when reaching the edge. It was supposed to be a simple console application, like certain older pc games.

I thought that was boring, and since the assignment was called a "game," I decided to go all the way with that part. I added textures, status bars (rather than numbers), colorful text, ascii art, etc. Also the professor said in class that someody once added a turn based combat system so I quickly added one and a whole (rather short tbh) story campaign.

This was made to run on Cloud9 on Amazon AWS because that's what we were using in class. idk maybe that means the original version runs on some linux distros. or all for all I know. Anyway, the Windows port has redone textures that Windows can print out.
